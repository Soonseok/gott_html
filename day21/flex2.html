          The discovery of the laws of dynamics, or the laws of motion, was a
          dramatic moment in the history of science. Before Newton’s time, the
          motions of things like the planets were a mystery, but after Newton
          there was complete understanding. Even the slight deviations from
          Kepler’s laws, due to the perturbations of the planets, were
          computable. The motions of pendulums, oscillators with springs and
          weights in them, and so on, could all be analyzed completely after
          Newton’s laws were enunciated. So it is with this chapter: before this
          chapter we could not calculate how a mass on a spring would move; much
          less could we calculate the perturbations on the planet Uranus due to
          Jupiter and Saturn. After this chapter we will be able to compute not
          only the motion of the oscillating mass, but also the perturbations on
          the planet Uranus produced by Jupiter and Saturn!
